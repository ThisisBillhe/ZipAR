# ZipAR: Accelerating Auto-regressive Image Generation through Spatial Locality

This repository provides the implementation for our paper "ZipAR: Accelerating Auto-regressive Image Generation through Spatial Locality". Our approach can greatly accelerate the generation speed of auto-regressive (AR) visual generation models.

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04062) 

## Getting Started

Install the pre-trained AR visual generation models and ZipAR only modifies several lines of the code.
